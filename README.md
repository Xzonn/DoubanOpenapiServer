# douban-openapi-server

A Douban API server that provides an unofficial method for information gathering, currently, supporting several providers below:

- SeleniumProvider - which will open a headless Chrome to simulate the user interaction (Optional)
- HttpRequestProvider - which has leveraged `Requests & BeautifulSoup` for information gathering with no any browser interaction (By default)
- P2PCacheProvider - `ToDo` (Scrapy/SQLite/IPFS/BitTorrent/Web3Storage/Resilio File Sync/etc) - ??????

> Note: Any comments and issues are welcomed!

## Docker 

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

## Install

 - the toolkits of `python3` and `pipenv` are required by executing the following scripts,

  ```shell
  pipenv install
  pipenv shell

  export FLASK_APP=app.py
  export FLASK_ENV=development
  export FLASK_DEBUG=0
  flask run
  ```

  > Note: There're two providers to choose, by default, `HttpRequestProvider` will take place, which will be faster for information scraping, for `Selenium`, You have to follow the official instruction and build the docker image by yourself
